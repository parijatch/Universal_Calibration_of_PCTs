# Universal_Calibration_of_PCTs

This repository contains the code used to generate the simulation results presented in [1].

## Repository structure

- **`calibration heavy-tailed tests/`**  
  Contains code for simulating p-values from a multivariate *t* copula with zero location parameter. These simulations illustrate that the **Pareto Combination Test (PCT)** achieves universal (asymptotic) calibration, while the **Cauchy Combination Test (CCT)** becomes conservative under stronger tail dependence.

- **`power simulations/`**  
  Contains code for simulating p-values from a multivariate *t* copula with a non-null location parameter. The simulations demonstrate that PCT is uniformly at least as powerful as CCT, and strictly more powerful in most settings considered.

- **`data splitting and FCT/`**  
  Contains code implementing the **Fréchet Combination Test (FCT)**. Simulation results in this folder verify that FCT is asymptotically calibrated only under tail independence.
